                                                    🖊️ We'll have to store the sent otp and email and password in some state, which then will be compared with the otp submit by the new user.
                                                    🖊️ If the OTP matches, the user will be redirected to some basic details form. Where the user will update basic details and on submitting the details, a new will get created. And the user will be redirected to the home page

                                                    ⚠️ Found an Issue in the app, it's since i'am passing data using props in SignIn.js component, and so when i going directly from welcome page to sign-in page, then all the users is accessable and so i can match the sign-in credentials details from the list of users which i am getting in props from App.js component in SignIn component.

                                                    But the issue here will be when i'll refresh the sign-in page, then  i wont be getting the list of users in the props, it'll be undefined. So, if i'll try to find the signin in user, i wont be getting the user, because the users is defined.
                                                    To resolve this issue, there's one way, it's i'll make a callback function in App.js and when the user will click sign-in button after writing credentials, the callback function will be called and will check if the user exists in the list of all the users.
                                                    But there will few challenges- 1. Mainting the user login
                                                           2. Passing the logged in user data in different pages, becuase i dont want to use local storage for storing all the data. 
                                                           
                                                    Well i'll look into it when the issue will come. There's always some way 😄😉

                                                         InitializeApp is a crucial step in using Firebase because it sets up the connection between your application and your specific Firebase project. It provides the necessary details and configurations for Firebase services to work within your app. Without initialization, your app would not be able to access or interact with Firebase services.

                                                 🖊️ Major Challenge done here is displaying notification when user is successfully creating account or successfully loggin-in.
                                                 Because when we are successfully loggin-in or creating account, the page changes and so even though we are toasting the notification, because of page is changing the notification doesn't get displayed. 
                                                 🖊️ So dispalying notification in the next page when user successfully logs in or creates account. 
                                                 We are checking for users previous page where the user is getting redirected from.
                                                 📝 E.g;
                                                        In case of successful login, the user redirected from login page to profile-page, so in profile page we are checking users previous page and displaying notification.

                                                        In case of successful account creation, the user redirected from signup page to login-page, so in login page we are checking users previous page and displaying notification.


                                                        🔴 Still have to show notification when user signs out.

                                                        🖊️ Updated files for displaying successful signout notification
                                                        🖊️ used useLocation location to get the state which we have passed when navigating from any oage to signin page.
                                                        🖊️ We are setting current path in state of useNavigate when user is clicking logout, and since logout button is displayed only when user is logged in, so doesnt matter user is loggin out from which page, it will set that pages path in state.
                                                        🖊️ Then in login page, we are checking if there is any value in from key in state, if there is any then display successful logout notification and then empty the location.state.from. 
                                                        So when move from here and there it doesnt cath the from value and display the notification everytime.

                                                        🖊️ In this Context API, i have made a parent component and there are children components.
                                                        🖊️ The idea is to display "Vishal" in nested-D component without using the props.
                                                        🖊️ Component-A is parent component and Component-B, Component-C and Component-D are children components.
                                                        🖊️ NameContext.js is the context file where we have written code for NameContext
                                                        💡 The idea behind using Context-API is,
                                                        We made a context provider using "createContext" and then wrap that provider around the parent
                                                        Next with the help of useContext we use the values which are passed in provider

                                                 💡 The Idea is creating a simple e-commerce website where-
                                                        🖊️ User can signin, signup
                                                        🖊️ Customer can add to cart and remove from cart and proceed for checkout

                                                        💡 For protected routing, i'll be using encapsulating component concept.
                                                        🖊️ Encapsulating pages in the respective user type encapsulating components.

                                                 📝 Upto this date, differnt user types pages has been created and is encapsulated under their respective encapsulating components.
                                                 📝 Logic for redirecting has also been given in encapsulating components.
                                                 no different user type will be able to access different users pages.
                                                 E.g; 
                                                        ✒️ public userType wont be able to access admin and user pages
                                                        ✒️ user userType wont be able to access admin and public pages
                                                        ✒️ admin userType wont be able to access user and public pages

                                          🖊️ Made a simple page for signin-up using firebases google auth
                                          📝 We just have to first initialize the firebase in our application-
                                          To Initialize Firebase in Our App-
                                                 import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
                                                 // Your web app's Firebase configuration
                                                 const firebaseConfig = {
                                                 apiKey: "XXXaSyC79QfVQkRTjYSwDdLcZeu58Z6-_Xnvxxx",
                                                 authDomain: "fir-project-75d14.firebaseapp.com",
                                                 databaseURL: "https://fir-project-75d-XX-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
                                                 projectId: "fir-project-75dXX",
                                                 storageBucket: "fir-project-75d14.appspot.com",
                                                 messagingSenderId: "4933340013XX",
                                                 appId: "1:493334001379:web:7b1b8dd6f34cc9c236f7XX",
                                                 };

                                                 const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

                                          📝 Using firebase google auth for signing-up, we just have to import few stuffs from firebase.
                                                 import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider, signInWithPopup } from "firebase/auth";

                                                 const auth = getAuth(firebaseApp);
                                                 const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();

                                                 const signupWithGoogle = () => {
                                                        signInWithPopup(auth, provider);
                                                 };


                                                 I have implemented this using reacts Context API, basically created a firebase context for firebase instances and methods.
