                                                    🖊️ We'll have to store the sent otp and email and password in some state, which then will be compared with the otp submit by the new user.
                                                    🖊️ If the OTP matches, the user will be redirected to some basic details form. Where the user will update basic details and on submitting the details, a new will get created. And the user will be redirected to the home page

                                                    ⚠️ Found an Issue in the app, it's since i'am passing data using props in SignIn.js component, and so when i going directly from welcome page to sign-in page, then all the users is accessable and so i can match the sign-in credentials details from the list of users which i am getting in props from App.js component in SignIn component.

                                                    But the issue here will be when i'll refresh the sign-in page, then  i wont be getting the list of users in the props, it'll be undefined. So, if i'll try to find the signin in user, i wont be getting the user, because the users is defined.
                                                    To resolve this issue, there's one way, it's i'll make a callback function in App.js and when the user will click sign-in button after writing credentials, the callback function will be called and will check if the user exists in the list of all the users.
                                                    But there will few challenges- 1. Mainting the user login
                                                           2. Passing the logged in user data in different pages, becuase i dont want to use local storage for storing all the data. 
                                                           
                                                    Well i'll look into it when the issue will come. There's always some way 😄😉

                                                         InitializeApp is a crucial step in using Firebase because it sets up the connection between your application and your specific Firebase project. It provides the necessary details and configurations for Firebase services to work within your app. Without initialization, your app would not be able to access or interact with Firebase services.

                                   👉🏾 05- Firebase Authentication
                                          🖊️ In this Folder, we are doing Firebase Authentication
                                          🖊️ For that we'll use Firebase Authentication Service.
                                          🖊️ First we made a signUp form from where the user can SignUp using Email and Password
                                          🖊️ Next we are using Firebase Authentication to Login the user using Email and Password.

                                          📝 Fire we'll have to import {getAuth} from firebase/auth
                                          📝 We'll then export the function
                                          📝 We'll then import {signInWithEmailAndPassword} from firebase/auth

                                          ```
