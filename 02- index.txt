                                                    🖊️ The App is Post-Comment-Reply App
                                                    📝 The idea is that we are accessing users from JSON placeholder, those users will be able to make post and comment and Replies
                                                    📝 Among the users, one user will login and make a post, the post will be displayed on a common page to display all the posts of all the users and the particular user can its post by going on its profile
                                                    📝 Those Users who didn't have made the post when login will able to see the posts on the common posts page and will be able to make commnent and replies for the particular post
                                                    🧑🏾‍💻 Focuses on structuring nested datas and handling states and routes and protected routes

                                                    🖊️ Changed the folder structure little
                                                    🖊️ Basic Application Layout Made, with the proper protected route for different users
                                                    🖊️ There are two user types- Public and Application user
                                                    🖊️ #Public users are basically the users who arent logged
                                                    🖊️ #Application Users are basically who are logged in
                                                    🖊️ Public Users pages- Signin, Signup, Welcome 
                                                    🖊️ Application Users pages- About, Contact, Home, posts, profile
                                                    📝 There are encapsulating components, they have their respective children components
                                                    📝 In encapsulating components the logics has been set for accessing pages.
                                                        Like- the public user won't be able to access Application users pages and the Application Users wont be able to access Public users pages unless they are logged out.

                                    👉🏾 02) Updated the signup form with a new idea and installed MUI for modal component and installed react-toastify 
                                                    🖊️ The new idea is that, the user will signup using email and password.
                                                    🖊️ An email with the OTP will be sent to the users email and a popup modal to confirm the email will open.
                                                    🖊️ We'll have to store the sent otp and email and password in some state, which then will be compared with the otp submit by the new user.
                                                    🖊️ If the OTP matches, the user will be redirected to some basic details form. Where the user will update basic details and on submitting the details, a new will get created. And the user will be redirected to the home page
