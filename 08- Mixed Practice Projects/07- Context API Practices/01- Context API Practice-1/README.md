# React COntext API

👉🏾 This Project is a simple React's Context API practice.
👉🏾 In this project, a simple Login Context is made and storing if the user is login or not.
👉🏾 For the practice, we have given a signup page, from where the new-user can create an account
👉🏾 If the username and email already exist, the signup willl not proceed
👉🏾 No database is getting used as for now. So as soon as the application is refreshed, all the states will come to default ones.
👉🏾 There's one default user created-
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***username: "vishalam36",
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***firstName: "Vishal",
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***lastName: "Chauhan",
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***email: "vishalam36@gmail.com",
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***location: "Pune",
**\*\***\*\***\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***\*\***\*\***password: "123456"
